# Shift Planner Application

This repository contains a simple web application built with **Django** and **Tailwind**, designed to showcase a basic shift planning tool with automation.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a web-based shift planning application designed to automate the complex process of creating duty rosters for nursing stations. It aims to streamline a typically time-consuming and error-prone task, providing a more efficient solution for healthcare management.

## üí° Idea and Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from observing my girlfriend, who works as a nurse. I witnessed firsthand the significant amount of manual effort and time she had to dedicate to creating shift schedules for her nursing ward. It became clear that there was a strong need for a more automated and intelligent solution.

From a personal development perspective, I was also looking for a complex project that would allow me to consolidate various programming concepts I had learned, particularly in web development with Django. Furthermore, this project serves as an experimental ground for exploring AI/ML coding practices, pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve and testing the strengths and weaknesses of integrating such technologies into a practical application.

The core idea is to build a robust shift planning software with an emphasis on automated schedule generation, significantly reducing the manual burden on staff managers.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Currently Implemented)

* **Automated Shift Generation:** Core functionality to create shift plans based on predefined rules and parameters (e.g., minimum rest hours, maximum consecutive shifts).
* **Conflict Detection:** Automatically identifies and highlights scheduling conflicts (e.g., overlapping shifts, insufficient rest, max consecutive shifts exceeded).
* **Employee Management:** CRUD operations for managing employee profiles, including qualifications, professional profiles, and allowed shifts.
* **Daily & Monthly Overviews:** Clear calendar views to visualize planned shifts for a given day or month.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

* **Django:** Web framework for the backend logic.
* **Python:** Programming language.
* **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
* **Tailwind:** For responsive design and UI components.
* **SQLite:** Default for development, extensible to PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.

## üìà Development Status

This first version of the application was conceptualized and developed over a weekend. While it provides core functionality for automated shift planning and basic management, it is still in active development. Future plans include:

* More *sophisticated AI/optimization algorithms* for schedule generation.
* Improved user experience and *additional reporting features*.
* Implementing different *user roles* (e.g. planner with full access, employee with restricted access).
* *Developing an API* for importing employee data, retrieving schedules, and submitting employee absences/preferences.
* Incorporating *additional employee preferences* (e.g. preferred days off, preferred shifts) to create schedules that are closer to real-world scenarios.
